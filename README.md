# maya-channel-box-plus
channel-box-plus will add search-ability over its attributes, and it will
colour user defined attributes, making them easier to distinguish. With
the threshold argument you can determine when to switch between colours,
the higher the threshold the more the 2 attributes will have to match up
to stay the same colour, this value can be adjusted using the colour settings
that are added to the native channel box menu.

In Maya 2022 and above the layout of the channel box is different which
breaks the table views when adding the search widget. For this reason it
is omitted for Maya 2022.
